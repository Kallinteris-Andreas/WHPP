\section*{Introduction}
This report analyzes our implementation of a standard genetic algorithm to solve the WHPP problem (according to the specification) where for genomes for work shifts of the employees.
The following sections show how each step of the algorithm was implemented.
\section*{Crossbreeding}
Due to the limitations of hard constraint (number of people working per shift) the option of crossbreeding all of the population together is not possible,
instead we breed 2 schedules a large amount of times,
which schedules are breed (randomly or by taking the scores into consideration) and how (randomly or by elitsm) does not appear to affect the performance in a measurable way.
\section*{Mutation}
\section*{Conclusion}
